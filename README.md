My personal landing page. Eventually becomes my blog.

Hi Everyone !
I am Ananya, and  usually go by the name anokhie, as my prefered handle.
I love dabbling in myriad code flavours, and usually end up with multiple
languages in each of my projects. I also love everything visual, so you might
find me clicking photographs on my iPhone 7 and dishing out colourful collages
on Photoshop or InkScape.

I have out up this project to sharpen my front-end skills as I learn HTML, CSS,
JS and a little PHP, and would love to share my experiences with you !
So fork it up, dive in, and lets build awesomeness together !

P.S :: I'm an individual dev, so I'd love to see your pull requests. Keep them
coming !!! ;)
